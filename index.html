       <h2>Safety & Convoy Discipline</h2>
       <ul>
         <li>Keep about a three-second gap behind the vehicle ahead (give yourself extra room if it's wet, slippery or visibility is reduced).</li>
         <li>Use your hazard lights only when there's a real hazard ahead — stay in the left lane when you can, and please no overtaking or squeezing past other cars in the convoy.</li>
         <li>Just follow the lead car, stay within view of the sweeper vehicle, and if something comes up — a delay, a hazard, or a stoppage — drop a quick message to or call the designated convoy marshal.</li>
       </ul>
